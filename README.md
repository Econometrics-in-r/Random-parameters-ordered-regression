# Random parameters ordered regression
R codes for statistical and econometrics models applied to transport data

This code has been produced as a part of my doctoral research. Please cite the following article(s) if you use this code in any kind:

Afghari, A.P., 2019. Detecting motor vehicle crash blackspots based on their underlying behavioural, engineering, and spatial causes (Doctoral dissertation, University of Queensland).

This R code corresponds with the two most common Random Parameters (mixed) ordered regression models: Random Parameters Ordered Logit and Random Parameters Ordered Probit models. Although this code has been written for crash severity data, it may be used for any dependent variable that is of ordered nature (e.g. Likert scale responses).

Prior to running the code, make sure to have "maxLik" and "randtoolbox" packages installed.
